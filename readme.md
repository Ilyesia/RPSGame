## Process
Laid out base HTML setup (header, FA-Icons, scoreboard). Adjusted CSS to fit design (scoreboard, circular inputs, overall design scheme). Started JavaScript with caching DOM's and setting scoreboard values to default 0. Added eventlisteners for input. Setup Math.random on an array for random computer inputs of the 5 choices. Setup all possible combinations for winning, losing and draws. Functions were created to confirm winning, losing and draws on the scoreboard and results flavour text. Lastly added glow and colored borders for the respective game results.

## Tools Used

## What I Learned
First time with applying aspects of DOM. Further improved application of JavaScript. Better overall design choices.
